Vimspire: Control your Chrome Browser from Vim!

Vimspire provides methods for remote controlling any Chrome Browser
that has the Tabspire Chrome Extension.

Vimspire lets you open and reload tabs in Chrome that you've saved
as under a mark character or given a name in Tabspire.

Vimspire also lets you:
- Switch focus from Vim to Chrome.
- Reload the currently focused Chrome tab.
- Open a URL in Chrome, either under the cursor or at the prompt.
- Open Google Searches in Chrome, from Vim's command line prompt.
- ...
- And more, if you let me know what you want!



2. Preferences

Set g:tabspire_client_id in your .vimrc to your (string) Tabspire Client ID.

Set g:vimspire_map_keys to 0 if you want to define your own function mappings.

More advanced debugging settings in s:default_opts.
